(These are just notes for myself as I'll otherwise forget. Feel free to ignore.)

Build Notes:

* Build dav1d (in ext/colorist/ext/avif/ext)
  * zsh dav1d.cmd

* Make Xcode project
  * cmake -G Xcode -DCOLORIST_AVIF_USE_AOM=0 -DAVIF_CODEC_DAV1D=1 -DAVIF_LOCAL_DAV1D=1 ..
  * open vantage.xcodeproj
* Symlink /usr/local/libdav1d.a into appropriate Debug/Release dirs in build dir
* Hook up AppIcon in General tab (TODO: figure out why this isn't automatic)
* Make sure codesigning is setup right
* Make sure hardening is enabled
* Make sure Version and Deployment Target are correct in General

Xcode Notes:

To hook up a new menu / keybind:

* Add new handler to AppDelegate
  * (compile?)
* Add new menu to Storyboard menu with keybind
* Ctrl+drag new menu to first responder icon (delegate) above, select new handler
* respond to fired event in Renderer (or elsewhere)

To make a Release build:

* Build Settings / Installation Directory / Release => /Applications
* Hook up AppIcon in General tab (TODO: figure out why this isn't automatic)
* Make sure codesigning is setup right
* Make sure hardening is enabled
* Make sure Version and Deployment Target are correct in General
* Archive
* Organizer should appear
  * Distribute App
  * if you need to "sign relevant contracts", visit developer.apple.com, click Account, sign in
  * wait for notarization
  * hit Distribute App again, export
* sudo pip3 install dmgbuild
* Run in exported dir:
  * coffee /path/to/vantageSource/src/osx/package/package.coffee
* upload final dmg
